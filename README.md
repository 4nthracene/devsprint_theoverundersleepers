Problem Statement: 
With losing social contact and unyielding attempts in making friends, we have developed anxiety and self doubt issues. Exceling at friendship has become an art and our preparation is defined by the number of followers we have on social platforms, whether non-genuine.
With increase in graphs of anxiety and mental health issues due to the uncertain times of covid, our natural approach to new people has faded. As a result, we find it difficult to introduce ourselves whether in a gathering or a social interview.

How ProxyMate Helps:
With proxymate, we aim to provide a safe solace to people who think, eating alone at a table is far better than introducing themselves to new people. With this, we let people get out of their fear zone by matching new with new friends yet, in a vicinity of their comfort zone for prime moments of their friendship.

This helps them to leave their shell, form genuine social relationships and talk about themselves in an open and non judgemental way
We believe everyone has a story and we refuse to let any of it die. With proxymate's software, the music interests connect two individuals.
And additionally, the count on me helps them to have a non judgemental interaction with a stranger on the other side from where they can start a new friendship too.
The comfort mail let's everyone enjoy the process of letter writing and the anticipation of a letter coming back from someone, to get out of their comfort zone.
We aim to provide a safe shelter to anyone who thinks that they are alone in their fight.
